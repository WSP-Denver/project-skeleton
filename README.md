# project-skeleton
A WSP project skeleton for starting a project build.

Installation:

1. Download if you'll be starting a new build
  + If you are wanting to help contribute to the project then please fork and create a pull request for your proposed changes.
  + Please follow the [contributing guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. Once you have downloaded the skeleton make a copy of index.html and rename copy to default.aspx to conform to WSP naming standards and to test locally on your IIS setup.
3. From the default.aspx file, move code for header and footer into corresponding include files (/include/header.aspx and /include/footer.aspx). These are commented so you can find them easily.
